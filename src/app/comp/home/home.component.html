    <p  style="font-size: 35px;" >About Me</p>
    <div class="container-fluid "> <div class="col-8"> 
        My Name Is <u>Ashwath Mittal</u>. I am a 10th Grade Student with keen
         Interest in Computer Science and Robotics. My Journey Began with Robotics when I was in class 6. 
         I have Learned <a href="#">Arduino</a> and <br><a href="#">Raspberry Pi</a> Based Robotics.
        Then in 2020 when Lockdown Started, Everything started happening online, while other kids were busy watching netflix all day  
        I introduced myself to Programming, first i started with <a href="##">Web Development</a>.
         After that I tried to get started with Ethical Hacking, but it was something I could not do at that time but this helped me get fair experience with Python and Linux.
         going forward in my journey I learned Raspberry Pi (successfully :D ). <br>
         Now currently I am Learning Python and have decided to learn Data Science.
